pentest-tools/api

By Daniel Gilbert

A REST API written in Go that serves payloads used in penetration testing.

The purpose of my API is to be like an msfvenom/msfconsole, but via a web API :).
Configure payloads and retrieve or deploy them remotely/locally.

Usage:

// Traversal Routes
GET /types/                                       # Get the payload types
GET /types/<payload_type>                         # List the payloads for a type
GET /types/<payload_type>/<payload_identifier>    # Get a specfic payload by ID or name

// Explicit Routes
GET /list/<payload_type>                          # List the payloads for a type
GET /info/<payload_type>/<payload_identifier>     # Get the info for a specific payload by ID or name
GET /get/<payload_type>/<payload_identifier>      # Get a specific payload by ID or name
GET /dump/<payload_type>                          # Prints details for all the payloads of a type
